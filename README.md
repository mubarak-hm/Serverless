# Event-Driven S3 Upload Notification System

A serverless application built with AWS SAM that sends email notifications when files are uploaded to an S3 bucket.

## Architecture

This project implements a simple event-driven architecture using:
- Amazon S3 for file storage
- AWS Lambda for event processing
- Amazon SNS for notifications

When a file is uploaded to the S3 bucket, a Lambda function is triggered, which then publishes a message to an SNS topic. The topic sends an email notification to subscribed email addresses.

## Prerequisites

- AWS Account
- AWS CLI configured with appropriate credentials
